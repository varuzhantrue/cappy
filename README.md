This is a general list to check if you are moving according to the schedule.

Week 1
You have created a web app project.
You have set up task tracking and decomposed milestones.
You have chosen all the frameworks and libraries that should be used in your project.
You have defined layers and the main interfaces for each layer.
You have partly implemented a solution in all three layers (at least 10% of the overall codebase).
Week 2
You have completed Â¾ of all the codebase.
You have a general plan of what to show on the demo.
Week 3
You have completed and demonstrated your project.
The mentors will help you to avoid common pitfalls you may come across while working on the project.

By completing the Capstone Project assignment, you will be able to:

apply the gained knowledge and skills of Java and Spring Web Development
gain hands-on experience in presenting a project
Let's take a look at the learning activities for the week ahead.


The Practice section of the following two weeks is focused on the Capstone Project: you will design layers, set up a database connection, design general interfaces and classes, and prepare your web app for the final demo.

You can complete the Capstone Project in about 40 hours, which you can divide between three weeks. However, there is always room for improvement, so feel free to spend more time if you need.

Time to get down to work!
